<h1>YumDrop</h1>

<p>This is a food delivery I developed using reactjs and firebase, where I focused on allowing google
authentication on the avatar, storing contact form data on Realtime database(firebase) and storing authenticated googles on firebase authentication.
</p>

<h2>MVPs</h2>

<p>The minimum viable products (MVPs) of the delivery app are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Menu page displaying food items from various restaurants.</li>
    <li>Add to cart action enabling users to add items to their shopping cart.</li>
    <li>Shopping cart page displaying all the items that the user has added to their cart, along with the total cost.</li>
</ul>
